        <h1>Future Skills Training & Tutoring Philosophy</h1>
        <p>
          At Future Skills Training & Tutoring, our mission is to empower students to achieve academic success while preparing for a rapidly evolving, AI‐driven future. Rooted in empathy, adaptability, and a genuine passion for education, we guide students in math and science while instilling critical thinking, ethical AI use, and lifelong learning skills. Our philosophy reflects a commitment to personalized growth, leveraging innovative tools, and building lasting relationships based on trust and shared goals.
        </p>

        <h2>Core Philosophical Principles</h2>
        <h3>1. Embracing Neurodiversity</h3>
        <p>
          Every brain is unique, and we celebrate these differences. Our founder’s own experience with neurodiversity informs a compassionate and flexible approach that ensures every student feels recognized, understood, and supported.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Empathy and Connection:</strong> Sharing personal stories to normalize struggles and inspire resilience.</li>
          <li><strong>Adaptability:</strong> Adjusting strategies to meet the evolving needs of each student.</li>
          <li><strong>Growth-Oriented Mindset:</strong> Viewing challenges as opportunities for learning and self-improvement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Personalized Learning Framework</h3>
        <p>
          Recognizing that every learning journey is unique, we work to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Conduct Initial Assessments:</strong> Understand each student’s strengths, challenges, and objectives.</li>
          <li><strong>Develop Customized Strategies:</strong> Tailor lesson plans to fit each student’s learning style and goals.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Ethical AI Integration</h3>
        <p>
          We prepare students to thrive in an AI-driven world by:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No Cheating Ever Policy:</strong> Encouraging AI as a tool for understanding—not a shortcut.</li>
          <li><strong>Critical Thinking Over Answers:</strong> Focusing on questioning, verifying, and truly understanding concepts.</li>
          <li><strong>Practical Demonstrations:</strong> Integrating AI tools for research, visualization, and problem-solving.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Lifelong Relevance of Learning</h3>
        <p>
          Learning goes beyond academic requirements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Real-World Application:</strong> Equipping students with skills that extend into everyday life and future careers.</li>
          <li><strong>Empowerment Through Understanding:</strong> Connecting educational concepts to practical, future uses.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tutoring Strategies</h2>
